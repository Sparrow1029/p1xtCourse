# p1xtCourse
Me working through the p1xt Javascript course here on GitHub!

Exactly what it sounds like. I needed to actually build things and get serious about learning this in my spare time.
I found the course on GitHub here, and it seems to be right up my alley for creating intermediate-level projects, and
hopefully will guide my hobby into a more useful skill.

I'm actually just a digital artist usally, and have been trying to learn programming for about a year and a half. Mostly
Python, but JavaScript seems to be more and more prevalent (and is also a super fun language).

If you somehow found this repo, and are a fan of Digital Art, my website is

If you are a huge StarWars nut like me as well, I and a friend have been making a webcomic: <i><strong>A Star Wars Comic</strong></i> 
for 6 months (at the time of this writing). Check it out!
